# Overview

This repository has been moved to https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/graphene/ai-interfaces

This repository collects common interfaces between AI4EU Acumos components in the AI4EU resources catalog.

* The main aim here is to collect and document interfaces.
* The aim is not to provide implementations.

This repository is currently managed by Peter Schueller <peter.schueller@tuwien.ac.at>.

# Directory Structure

* Each interface is put into a separate directory.
* Documentation and, if existing, example code is also put into that directory, maybe in subdirectories `docs/` and `examples/`.

# How to contribute

* Make a branch for your suggested new interface or for your suggested interface change.
* Do not forget to add your interface to the list at the end of this file [Readme.md](https://github.com/ai4eu/interfaces/edit/master/README.md).
* Create a Pull Request against master and suggest at least one reviewer.
* If you are a member of the consortium and have merge permissions for this repository, depending on the situation you might merge the Pull Request yourself.

  - Lack of criticism and lack of reactions to your Pull Request for a few days could be a good reason to publish the content instead of waiting.
  - Please be respectful of other opinions.
